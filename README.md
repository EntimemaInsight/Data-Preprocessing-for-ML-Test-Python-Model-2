# Data-Preprocessing-for-ML-Test-Python-Model-2
This project demonstrates the detection of outliers using three different methods: Interquartile Range Method (IQR), KMeans Clustering, and Scaling. The dataset used for this analysis contains information about abalone, a type of shellfish.

## Introduction
Outliers are data points that significantly deviate from the normal pattern or distribution of a dataset. Identifying and handling outliers is crucial in data preprocessing for machine learning models, as outliers can negatively impact the model's performance and accuracy.

## Methods Used
1. Interquartile Range Method (IQR):
The IQR method identifies outliers based on the interquartile range, which measures the spread of data.
Outliers are detected by determining the range within which the majority of the data lies and considering data points outside this range as outliers.
KMeans Clustering:

2. KMeans clustering: 
This is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that groups data points into clusters based on similarity.
Outliers can be detected by analyzing the data points that do not belong to any cluster or form a separate cluster.
Scaling:

3. Scaling: 
The process of normalizing the data to a common scale, ensuring that all features contribute equally.
Scaling helps prevent features with larger magnitudes from dominating the analysis and biasing the results.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about abalone, including various physical measurements and the number of rings (which indicates the age of the abalone). The dataset is preprocessed by removing the gender section to focus solely on the numerical features.

## Pairplot Visualization
To gain insights into the relationships between different features in the dataset, a pairplot visualization is created. The pairplot displays pairwise scatterplots of the numerical features, showcasing the correlations and distributions between variables. This visualization aids in understanding the data distribution and identifying potential outliers visually.

## Results
1.Interquartile Range Method (IQR):
The IQR method is used to detect outliers by calculating the interquartile range and defining a range outside which data points are considered outliers. The method is applied to each feature individually, and data points exceeding the defined range are identified as outliers.

2. KMeans Clustering:
KMeans clustering is utilized to identify outliers by grouping data points into clusters. Outliers can be detected as data points that do not belong to any cluster or form a separate cluster.

3. Scaling:
Scaling is applied to the dataset before using distance-based algorithms like KMeans clustering. Scaling ensures that all features contribute equally and prevents any single feature from overshadowing others.
